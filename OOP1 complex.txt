// This file demonstrates operator overloading for user-defined types.
// Theory:
// - **Operator Overloading**: Extending the functionality of operators to work with user-defined objects.
// - **Friend Functions**: Provide external access to private members for operator overloading.
// - **Complex Number Operations**: Demonstrates addition and multiplication of complex numbers using overloaded operators.
// Example: The program performs arithmetic on complex numbers, showcasing operator overloading for `+` and `*`.
